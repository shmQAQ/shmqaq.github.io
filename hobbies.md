# Hobbies
- **Music** I'm a Hifi fan and I love listening to music. I have a pair of Akg N5005 and Acoustune Hs1300S.And my front equipment is Ibasso DX220.Hope to meet more friends who love music.

- **Reading** I like reading books about novels, philosophy, and science. Among these novels, I'm fond of science fiction and magical-realism novels.And my favorite writer is García Márquez,I'v read his novel *One Hundred Years of Solitude* for five times.

- **Cooking** I like cooking and I'm good at cooking Sichuan cuisine. In some aspects, cooking is like chemistry, you need to control the temperature and the amount of ingredients.Unfortunately, I do not like to wash dishes.

- **ACG** I like watching anime and reading manga in my free time *Maybe*
